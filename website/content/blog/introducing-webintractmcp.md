# Introducing WebIntractMCP: Transforming Web Applications into MCP Servers

Today, I'm excited to introduce **WebIntractMCP**, an innovative open-source ecosystem that bridges the gap between web applications and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This groundbreaking project enables any web application to become an MCP server, allowing chatbots and AI clients to control user sessions seamlessly.

## The Problem We're Solving

Modern web applications are becoming increasingly complex, and users often need guidance navigating through various features and workflows. While chatbots and AI assistants have become more sophisticated, they've been limited in their ability to directly interact with web applications. Until now.

Traditional solutions require:
- Complex browser automation setups
- Brittle selectors that break with UI changes
- Limited real-time communication capabilities
- Framework-specific implementations

## Enter WebIntractMCP

WebIntractMCP solves these challenges by creating a standardized way for web applications to expose their functionality through the Model Context Protocol. This enables:

- **Real-time Communication**: Robust bidirectional communication using SignalR
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with React, Angular, Vue, or any JavaScript framework
- **Dynamic Tool Registration**: Configure tools with simple JSON files
- **Session-based Control**: Secure per-user session management
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and Docker support

## Architecture Overview

The ecosystem consists of two main components:

### 1. @web-intract-mcp/client (TypeScript Library)
A lightweight, framework-agnostic library that integrates into your web application:

```typescript
import { createWebIntractMCPController } from '@web-intract-mcp/client';

const controller = createWebIntractMCPController();
await controller.loadTools('/mcp-tools.json');
await controller.createSession('http://localhost:8080');
```

### 2. WebIntractMCPServer (.NET Server)
A robust MCP server built with .NET 9 and ASP.NET Core:

```bash
# Quick start with Docker
docker run -p 8080:8080 webintract-mcp-server
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Automated Testing
Transform your manual testing workflows into automated, AI-driven test scenarios:

```json
{
  "toolId": "user-registration-test",
  "title": "Test User Registration",
  "description": "Automated testing of user registration flow",
  "mode": "silent",
  "steps": [
    {
      "targetElement": "#email",
      "action": { "type": "type", "element": "#email", "value": "{{email}}" }
    },
    {
      "targetElement": "#password",
      "action": { "type": "type", "element": "#password", "value": "{{password}}" }
    },
    {
      "targetElement": "#register-btn",
      "action": { "type": "click", "element": "#register-btn" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. User Onboarding
Create intelligent, guided tours that adapt to user behavior:

```json
{
  "toolId": "smart-onboarding",
  "title": "Smart User Onboarding",
  "description": "Intelligent onboarding that adapts to user progress",
  "mode": "guided",
  "steps": [
    {
      "targetElement": "#dashboard",
      "action": { "type": "highlight", "element": "#dashboard" },
      "description": "Welcome to your dashboard! This is where you'll find all your important information."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Process Automation
Automate repetitive tasks with AI-powered workflows:

```json
{
  "toolId": "invoice-processing",
  "title": "Process Invoice",
  "description": "Automates invoice data entry and processing",
  "mode": "interactive",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "invoiceData": {
        "type": "object",
        "description": "Invoice information extracted from document"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Features That Set Us Apart

### 1. **Full MCP Protocol Support**
Complete implementation including tool discovery, invocation, and all response types (Text, Image, Audio, etc.).

### 2. **Real-time Communication**
Built on SignalR with support for WebSockets, ServerSentEvents, and LongPolling for maximum compatibility.

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
Provides users with clear visual feedback during tool execution, enhancing the user experience.

### 4. **Page-specific Tools**
Define tools that work with specific pages or application states for precise control.

### 5. **Security First**
Session-based isolation ensures that multiple users can safely use the system simultaneously.

## Getting Started in Minutes

### 1. Install the Library
```bash
npm install @web-intract-mcp/client
```

### 2. Create Your Tools Configuration
```json
[
  {
    "toolId": "welcome-demo",
    "title": "Welcome Demo",
    "description": "A simple demonstration tool",
    "mode": "guided",
    "steps": [
      {
        "targetElement": "#welcome-button",
        "action": { "type": "click", "element": "#welcome-button" },
        "description": "Click the welcome button to get started!"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### 3. Initialize in Your App
```typescript
// Works with any framework!
const controller = createWebIntractMCPController();
await controller.loadTools('/mcp-tools.json');
await controller.createSession('http://localhost:8080');
```

## The Technology Stack

We've chosen modern, robust technologies:

- **Client Library**: TypeScript 5.8+, SignalR, Shepherd.js
- **MCP Server**: .NET 9, ASP.NET Core, SignalR
