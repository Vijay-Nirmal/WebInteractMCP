# Getting Started

Welcome to WebIntractMCP! This guide will help you get started with transforming your web application into an MCP server.

## What is WebIntractMCP?

WebIntractMCP is an innovative MCP (Model Context Protocol) ecosystem that enables any web application to become an MCP server, allowing chatbots and other MCP clients to control client sessions and complete intended actions on behalf of users.

## Key Components

### üìö @web-intract-mcp/client
TypeScript library for client-side integration. This framework-agnostic library can be integrated into any JavaScript framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).

### üñ•Ô∏è WebIntractMCPServer
Ready-to-deploy Docker MCP server for protocol handling. Built with .NET 9 and ASP.NET Core for robust performance.

### üéØ Sample Implementation
Complete Angular + .NET example demonstrating the full integration workflow.

## Architecture Overview

        E[Tools Configuration<br/>JSON File]
    end
    
    subgraph "WebIntractMCP Ecosystem"

        C["@web-intract-mcp/client"<br/>TypeScript Library]
    end

    E -->|Configure| C
```

## Quick Installation

### 1. Install the Client Library

```bash
npm install @web-intract-mcp/client
```

### 2. Run the MCP Server

```bash
# Using Docker
docker run -p 8080:8080 webintract-mcp-server

# Or build from source
cd server/WebIntractMCPServer
dotnet run
```

### 3. Configure Your Tools

Create a `mcp-tools.json` file in your web application's public directory:

```json
[
  {
    "toolId": "click-button",
    "title": "Click Button",
    "description": "Clicks a specific button on the page",
    "mode": "silent",
    "steps": [
      {
        "targetElement": "#submit-btn",
        "action": { "type": "click", "element": "#submit-btn" }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### 4. Initialize in Your Web App

```typescript
import { createWebIntractMCPController } from '@web-intract-mcp/client';

const controller = createWebIntractMCPController();
await controller.loadTools('/mcp-tools.json');
await controller.createSession('http://localhost:8080');
```
